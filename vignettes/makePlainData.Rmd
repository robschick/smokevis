Goal of this is to simply explore making some simulated data that we can visualise with a flexidashboard.

## Data Info

The idea is to take some various geocoded locations, and add them in to a data frame. These will be master ones to be recycled. These will contain a few candidate locations like: `home`, `work`, `grocery`, `pub1`, `pub2`, etc. This will just be a starting point.

```{r}
library(smokevis)
locs1
```

Those are the raw data, and we can visualise them as follows

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
library(leaflet)
m <- leaflet() %>% setView(lng = -2.9, lat = 56.403, zoom = 11)
m %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers(lng = locs1$lng, lat = locs1$lat, popup = locs1$location)
```
