Description: The goal of this package is to build simulated smoking data using
    a few different simulation engines. One of these will be simple based on
    geocoded address locations representing work, home, etc. One will be the
    HSMM data based on the caterpillar model from Zucchini et al. (2008)
    Biometrics 64(3):807-815. Using these the package will allow for a few
    different visuals: shiny, and static print to start.
